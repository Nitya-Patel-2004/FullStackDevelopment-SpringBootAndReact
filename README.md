## Full Stack Application Development with Spring Boot & React
This repository is my living portfolio and commitment to becoming a versatile Full Stack Developer specializing in the powerful Spring Boot (Java) and React (TypeScript) ecosystem. I translate theoretical concepts into robust, runnable, and deployable applications.

##  Core Technology Stack
Backend (API): Java & Spring Boot 3

Focus: Scalable RESTful Web Services, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Unit Testing.

Frontend (UI): React & TypeScript

Focus: Component architecture, React Hooks, State Management (Redux/Context API), Modern UI/UX.

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL

Focus: Data modeling, Efficient SQL querying, Relational Mapping (JPA/Hibernate).

Tools & DevOps: Git, Docker, Maven/Gradle

Focus: Version control, CI/CD principles, Containerization, API Testing (Postman/Swagger).

## Learning & Implementation Roadmap (Future Work)
The value of this repository is its active development and the challenges I am solving next.

API Development: Implementing a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application pattern.

Security: Integrating JWT-based tokens and Role-Based Access Control using Spring Security.

State Management: Implementing efficient, scalable state handling in React (e.g., Redux Toolkit).

Validation: Ensuring data integrity with comprehensive client-side and server-side validation.

Deployment & DevOps: Containerizing the application with Docker and exploring cloud deployment (e.g., AWS/Heroku).

Testing: Writing comprehensive Unit and Integration tests (JUnit/Mockito & React Testing Library).

## Why Review This Repository?
